                    Hello!! My name is Rushikesh and I love to design and build frontend application. My Interest in frontend development started back in 2014 when I 
                    started to play with Chrome DevTools to change the web page contents and add my own funny one. I got to know more about CSS too when I tried to 
                    change the color of text and started playing around it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at the IT industry. I've worked in backend developement too with skills in 
                    Java, Spring Boot, Microservices. If I talk about the DevOps, so I've knowledge in Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes. 
                    <br> Fun Fact, I'm learning DevOps ðŸ˜ƒ
